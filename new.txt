    To delete an unused sidebar menu item (e.g., "Reports"), follow these steps. 

### Step 1: Remove from Backend (Data Source)
The menu items are defined and seeded from the backend. You must remove them here first.

**File:** `AUTHApi\Data\MenuSeeder.cs`
1.  Open the file and locate the `SeedMenuItemsAsync` method.
2.  Find the code block creating the `MenuItem` you want to delete.
    *   *Example:* To delete "Reports":
        ```csharp
        // DELETE THIS BLOCK
        new MenuItem
        {
            Title = "Reports", ViewId = "reports", Icon = "ReportsIcon",
            Url = "/reports",
            Permission = Permissions.Reports.Sidebar,
            RequiredPolicyId = GetPolicyId(Permissions.Reports.Sidebar),
            Order = 9
        },
        ```
3.  If the item is added to a list (like `var items = new List<MenuItem> { ... }`), make sure to remove it from there too.
4.  **Action:** Save the file and restart your backend application. The seeder runs on startup and will automatically remove the item from the database table `MenuItems` because of the line `context.MenuItems.RemoveRange(context.MenuItems);`.

### Step 2: Remove Frontend Mapping
The frontend maps the backend `ViewId` to a React component. 

**File:** `AUTH-Frontend\src\components\dashboard\ViewMapper.tsx`
1.  Open the file and find the `getViewComponent` function.
2.  Locate the `case` statement matching the `ViewId` of the item you deleted (e.g., `'reports'`).
3.  Delete the case block:
    ```typescript
    // DELETE THIS
    case 'reports':
        return <div className="p-8 text-center text-gray-500">Reports Module (Coming Soon)</div>;
    ```
    *   *Note:* If it imports a component (e.g., `import ReportsView from './ReportsView';`), delete the import statement at the top of the file as well.

### Step 3: Delete Unused Component Files (Optional)
If the menu item was pointing to a specific React component that is no longer used anywhere else, you should delete that file to keep the project clean.
*   *Example:* If you had `AUTH-Frontend\src\components\dashboard\ReportsView.tsx`, you can delete this file.

### Step 4: Remove Unused Icons (Optional)
**File:** `AUTH-Frontend\src\components\dashboard\SidebarIcons.tsx`
1.  If the menu item used a unique icon (e.g., `ReportsIcon`) that is not used by any other menu, you can remove its export from this file to reduce bundle size.
